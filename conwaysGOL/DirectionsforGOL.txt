Directions to use Game of Life

This program simulates iterations of the Game of Life, first introduced by John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a 
zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or,
for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.

STEPS

1.) In this rendition, when prompted the user will enter "1" to enter the path for a txt file he created that houses the
points and end point (-1,-1) that he would like to begin with or enter "2" for a set of random points or enter "3" to exit and not play! 

2.) The user will then be prompted to enter a number of iterations, in where they will be able to input as many iterations as they'd like.

3.) After that, the user may sit back and watch the magic happen as the board/panel will go through a series of rules and configure the cell population based on that.

4.) After all is said and done the user will input the filename he'd like to create that will display all end points through each iteration.

5.) The user will then be prompted to continue and start a new game or exit. Value "1" is for Yes/Continue and Value "2" is for Exit. Enjoy!
